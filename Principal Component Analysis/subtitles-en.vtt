00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:04.630
In the previous videos, we looked at properties of

2
00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.590
Inner Products to compute Lengths, Angles and Distances.

3
00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:13.005
We focused on inner products of finite dimensional vector spaces.

4
00:00:13.005 --> 00:00:18.170
In this video, we will look at two examples of inner products of other types of vectors,

5
00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.165
inner products of functions and inner products of random variables.

6
00:00:22.165 --> 00:00:24.495
The inner products we discussed so far were

7
00:00:24.495 --> 00:00:27.005
defined for vectors with a finite number of entries,

8
00:00:27.005 --> 00:00:28.940
and we can think of these vectors as

9
00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.550
discrete functions with a finite number of function values.

10
00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.440
The concept of an inner product can be

11
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.325
generalized to continuous valued functions as well.

12
00:00:37.325 --> 00:00:41.945
And then the sum over individual components of vectors turns into an integral,

13
00:00:41.945 --> 00:00:46.380
and the inner product between two functions is defined as follows.

14
00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.625
You can write that the inner product between two functions

15
00:00:50.625 --> 00:00:56.367
u and v is the integral of an interval from a to b.

16
00:00:56.367 --> 00:00:59.820
A u of x times v of x,

17
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:06.215
d x, and as with our normal inner product,

18
00:01:06.215 --> 00:01:10.685
we can define Norms and Orthogonality by looking at this inner product.

19
00:01:10.685 --> 00:01:13.215
If that integral evaluates to zero,

20
00:01:13.215 --> 00:01:15.840
the functions u and v are orthogonal.

21
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.386
Let's have a look at an example.

22
00:01:18.386 --> 00:01:22.695
If we choose u of x equals

23
00:01:22.695 --> 00:01:29.705
Sine x and v of x is Cosine of x,

24
00:01:29.705 --> 00:01:34.435
and we define f of x to v,

25
00:01:34.435 --> 00:01:37.730
u of x times v of x,

26
00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:43.430
which is a Sine x times Cosine x then we're going to end up with this function.

27
00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.550
This function is Sine x times Cosine x.

28
00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:51.245
We see that this function is odd,

29
00:01:51.245 --> 00:01:55.400
which means that f of minus x equals minus f of x.

30
00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.980
If we choose the integral limit to be minus Pi and plus Pi then the

31
00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:07.635
integral of this product Sine of x times Cosine of x evaluates to zero.

32
00:02:07.635 --> 00:02:10.890
And that means that Sine and Cosine are Orthogonal,

33
00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.535
and actually holds that,

34
00:02:12.535 --> 00:02:19.195
if you look at a set of functions say one Cosine x,

35
00:02:19.195 --> 00:02:21.250
Cosine of two x,

36
00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.580
Cosine three x and so on,

37
00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.310
that all of these functions are Orthogonal to

38
00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.840
each other if we integrate from minus Pi to plus Pi.

39
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.325
Another example for defining an inner product between

40
00:02:33.325 --> 00:02:37.975
unusual types are random variables or random vectors.

41
00:02:37.975 --> 00:02:39.985
If we have two random variables,

42
00:02:39.985 --> 00:02:43.698
which are uncorrelated, then we know the following relationship.

43
00:02:43.698 --> 00:02:51.280
We know that, the variance of x plus y is the variance

44
00:02:51.280 --> 00:03:00.010
of x plus the variance of y where x and y are random variables.

45
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.420
Remember that variances are measured in squared units.

46
00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.325
This looks very much like the Pythagorean Theorem for right triangles,

47
00:03:08.325 --> 00:03:15.240
that one states that c squared equals a squared plus b squared.

48
00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:23.700
If we look at triangles of this form where this is a,

49
00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.580
b, and this is c. Let's see whether we can find

50
00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:34.240
a geometric interpretation of the variance relation of uncorrelated random variables.

51
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:38.170
Random variables can be considered vectors in a vector space and we can

52
00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:43.240
define inner products to obtain geometric properties of these random variables.

53
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:49.795
If we define the inner product between two random variables between

54
00:03:49.795 --> 00:03:56.210
x and y to be the covariance between x and y,

55
00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:59.795
we see that the covariance is Symmetric,

56
00:03:59.795 --> 00:04:03.305
Positive Definite, and Linear.

57
00:04:03.305 --> 00:04:07.405
So linearity would mean that

58
00:04:07.405 --> 00:04:14.700
the covariance of lambda times x plus y and z where x,

59
00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.090
y and z are random variables,

60
00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.430
and lambda is a real number,

61
00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:26.510
is lambda times the covariance between x and

62
00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:32.790
z plus the covariance between y and z.

63
00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:39.000
And if the length of a random variable is

64
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:46.095
the square root of the covariance between of x with itself,

65
00:04:46.095 --> 00:04:52.594
which is the square root of the variance of x,

66
00:04:52.594 --> 00:04:58.525
then this is the standard deviation of the random variable x.

67
00:04:58.525 --> 00:05:05.365
So this is the length of a random variable.

68
00:05:05.365 --> 00:05:08.590
Therefore, the zero vector is a vector that has no uncertainty,

69
00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.635
that means standard deviation is zero.

70
00:05:11.635 --> 00:05:14.860
If we now look at the angle between two random variables,

71
00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.025
we get the following relationship.

72
00:05:17.025 --> 00:05:21.100
We get the Cosine of theta,

73
00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:25.150
which is the angle between two random variables is by

74
00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:29.301
definition the inner product between the two random variables,

75
00:05:29.301 --> 00:05:33.775
divided by the length of the first random variable,

76
00:05:33.775 --> 00:05:37.742
times the length of the second random variable.

77
00:05:37.742 --> 00:05:43.940
And if we now write this out using the definition of our inner product,

78
00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:50.087
we get the covariance between x and y,

79
00:05:50.087 --> 00:05:57.560
divided by the square root

80
00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:01.755
of the variance of x,

81
00:06:01.755 --> 00:06:06.030
times the variance of y.

82
00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:12.437
And this evaluates to zero if the covariance between x and y is zero,

83
00:06:12.437 --> 00:06:16.620
and that is the case when x and y are uncorrelated.

84
00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:20.206
Coming back now to our geometric interpretation,

85
00:06:20.206 --> 00:06:30.655
we would now replace a with the standard deviation of x,

86
00:06:30.655 --> 00:06:36.050
b is the standard deviation of y,

87
00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:42.000
and c is the square root of

88
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:50.884
the variance of x plus the variance of y.

89
00:06:50.884 --> 00:06:56.050
And this is how we get our geometric interpretation of random variables.

90
00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:00.160
In this video, we looked at inner products of rather unusual objects,

91
00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.575
functions and random variables.

92
00:07:02.575 --> 00:07:05.500
However, even with functions and random variables,

93
00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:09.965
the inner product allows us to think about lengths and angles between these objects.

94
00:07:09.965 --> 00:07:11.320
In the case of random variables,

95
00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:15.400
we saw that the variance of the sum of two uncorrelated random variables can

96
00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:20.560
be geometrically interpreted using the Pythagorean Theorem.
